# ZMK Config

This repo contains the [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev) configuration files for my [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/), which I purchased from the amazing people at [Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz/). The keyboard layout is heavily inspired by [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) with very minor modifications. To deepen my understanding of ZMK, I recreated most of Miryoku's features from scratch, with help from the [ZMK Discord community](https://zmk.dev/community/discord/invite) and Nick Coutsos' beginner friendly [keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/).

## Keymap Features

- Graphite keyboard layout

	I'm using Graphite as the base layer for better typing ergonomics. I also have an `extra` layer with the QWERTY layout.

- Numbers & symbols on base layer

	Since the Corne does not have a dedicated number row, unlike larger boards, I've implemented [combo keys](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/combos) on the base [layer](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/keymaps#layers) for quick access to numbers and symbols. The same numbers and symbols are also available on dedicated layers.

- Caps word & caps lock
 
 	The [Caps word](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/caps-word) key, located on the middle left corner row, triggers caps lock for a single word. This comes in handy when typing environment variables (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=123`) and short acronyms (`SQL`, `HTML`, `API`, `NASA`, etc.).

 	There is also an option to toggle the traditional caps lock behavior by pressing `shift` + `caps word`.

 - Sticky shift & sticky hyper

	The [Sticky shift](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/sticky-key) key, located on the bottom left corner row, keeps the shift key pressed until another key is pressed or the 2-second timer elapses (configurable), whichever comes first. It can also be manually toggled off by pressing `sticky shift` again.

- Homerow mods

	[Homerow mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) are powerful and convenient, but can be tricky to set up. I've settled on a comfortable configuration that minimizes accidental modifier key activations.

	```c++
	hrm_l: homerow_mods_left {
		compatible = "zmk,behavior-hold-tap";
		label = "HOMEROW_MODS_LEFT_HAND";
		bindings = <&kp>, <&kp>;

		#binding-cells = <2>;
		hold-trigger-key-positions = <6 7 8 9 10 11 18 19 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 34 35 39 40 41>;
		tapping-term-ms = <225>;
		flavor = "balanced";
		hold-trigger-on-release;
		quick-tap-ms = <175>;
		require-prior-idle-ms = <130>;
	};

	hrm_r: homerow_mods_right {
		compatible = "zmk,behavior-hold-tap";
		label = "HOMEROW_MODS_RIGHT_HAND";
		bindings = <&kp>, <&kp>;

		#binding-cells = <2>;
		tapping-term-ms = <225>;
		hold-trigger-key-positions = <0 1 2 3 4 5 12 13 14 15 16 17 24 25 26 27 28 29 36 37 38>;
		hold-trigger-on-release;
		flavor = "balanced";
		quick-tap-ms = <175>;
		require-prior-idle-ms = <130>;
	};
	```
	Refer to the [hold-tap](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/hold-tap) docs for detailed explanations of each option.

	In short, if you find yourself accidentally triggering a modifier, consider increasing the tapping term to a range of 200-250ms.
	- `tapping-term-ms = <230>;`

	or changing the hold-tap flavor to tap-preferred: 
	- `flavor = "tap-preferred";`

	For additional guidance:

	> The most important tip I can give is to get into the habit of typing with quick, swift taps. The goal is to reduce the time between press and release to the minimum. Donâ€™t focus on pressing keys, but on tapping keys. -- [precondition](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods#quick-swift-taps)


- Extra symbols layer (sym2)

	In addition to Miryoku's stock symbol layer, I've also added a symbol layer labeled `sym2`, inspired by Pascal Getreuer's [Designing a Symbol Layer](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html). However, maintaining the same symbols across multiple layers adds a lot of mental overhead, which is why this extra layer has largely gone unused. I'm still making changes, looking for ways to merge parts of this layer into the main `sym` layer through the use of combo keys. In the future, I plan on replacing this layer with a [mouse emulation](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference#mouse) layer as soon as mouse support is implemented in ZMK.

- Miryoku reference

	The rest of my layout mirrors Miryoku's. Check out the [reference manual](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference) for further details.
